## Overview

Graph Loops Finder is a command-line tool that takes a CSV file containing graph edges as input and identifies all loops in the graph. Loops are cycles of nodes where a path returns to the starting node. The application utilizes NetworkX library for graph representation and simple cycle detection.

## Features

- ‚úîÔ∏è Identifies loops in a directed graph represented as edges in a CSV file.
- üìà Generates a visual representation of the graph with highlighted loops.
- üìã Outputs the detected loops in a user-friendly format.

## Demo

## Requirements

- üêç Python 3.x
- üîó NetworkX library
- üìä Matplotlib library
- üêº Pandas library

## Installation

1. üì• Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/XMaroRadoX/graph-loops-finder.git
cd graph-loops-finder

```

2. üì¶ Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

3. üèóÔ∏è Build the app:

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
python -m PyInstaller --onefile app/gui.py

```

or you can use the run.sh script to quickly get up and running

## Usage

To find loops in your graph, run the following command:

```bash
python graph_loops_finder.py /path/to/edges.csv

```

Replace `/path/to/edges.csv` with the path to your CSV file containing the graph edges.

## CSV File Format

The CSV file should contain two columns: the source node and the target node, separated by a comma (`,`). Each row represents a directed edge in the graph.

Example CSV file:

```sh
A,B
B,C
C,A
D,E
E,F
F,D

```

## Examples

Let's consider the following CSV file `edges.csv` representing a graph:

```sh
A,B
B,C
C,A
D,E
E,F
F,D

```

Run the application:

```bash
python graph_loops_finder.py edges.csv

```

The output will be:

```html
Loops found:
A -> B -> C
E -> F -> D

```

A visualization of the graph with highlighted loops will also be displayed.
